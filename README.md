### Contents
- A detailed installation guide
- Fixed incompatibility issues. Running fine 07.2021
- A few program adjustments that eases the installation

### Program functionalities and contents
- PLCs and HMI
    - e!cockpit program that simulates input output and measurements.
    - A docker container that ports values from the PLCs OPC UA server to an MQTT broker. The container contains a python script that uses the "freeopcua"-library as the OPCUA-client and the "paho-mqtt"-library as the MQTT client.
- Cloud server:
    - Hosts a Grafana visualization. 
    - Simulation
    - Leak Detection
    - Observes the PLCs
## Requirements
- 3x Wago PFC200 PLCs
- A Wago TP600 PIO3 touch panel
- A Google-cloud server (or optionally a computer that can host the cloud-server locally).
- An MQTT-broker
